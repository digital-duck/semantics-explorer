- Author: Wen G. Gong
- arXiv ID: [To be updated when available]
- Submitted: January 2025

## üî¨ Research Methodology

This application implements the complete analytical framework described in the paper:

### Core Techniques
- **PHATE Manifold Analysis**: Reveals geometric patterns in semantic space
- **Cross-Model Validation**: Tests across 7+ embedding models
- **Multi-Method Comparison**: Validates findings across 8 dimensionality reduction techniques
- **Systematic Filtering**: Separates semantic content from structural scaffolding

### Key Findings Demonstrated
1. **Clustering Patterns**: Content words (ÂÆûËØç) form dense geometric neighborhoods
2. **Branching Patterns**: Function words (ËôöËØç) create linear pathway structures
3. **Universal Principles**: Geometric complexity correlates with semantic content across languages
4. **Domain-Specific Signatures**: Different semantic categories exhibit characteristic geometric patterns
